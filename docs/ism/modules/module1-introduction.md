# Module 1: Introduction to Information Systems

## Overview

Information Systems (IS) are combinations of hardware, software, data, people, and procedures that work together to process data and provide information to support organizational decision-making.

## 1. What is an Information System?

### Definition

An **Information System** is an organized combination of:
- **Hardware:** Physical components (computers, servers, networks)
- **Software:** Programs and applications
- **Data:** Raw facts and figures
- **People:** Users and IT professionals
- **Procedures:** Rules and guidelines for operation

**Characteristics:**
- Summarized data from TPS
- Periodic reports (daily, weekly, monthly)
- Structured decision support
- Examples: Sales reports, inventory reports

### Decision Support Systems (DSS)

**Purpose:** Support semi-structured and unstructured decisions

**Characteristics:**
- Interactive systems
- "What-if" analysis
